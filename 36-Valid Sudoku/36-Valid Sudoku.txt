36-Valid Sudoku
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/


1.HashSet
We will create a Hashset and will iterate through the 2-D array.We will store the value as follows:-
row="Row-"+i+"-"+Board[i][j]
col="Col-"+i+"-"+Board[i][j]
box="Box"+(r/3*3+c/3)+Board[i][j]

and we will check if any value already exist in hashset we will return the flag as false.So sudoku will be invalid.
