1-Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

This question has two solution:-

1.For Loop 
We will have two loop with i=0 and j=i+1 an dwill iterate till end of the array to find the exact match.
Time complexity:->O(n2)
Spce complexity:-O(1)


2.HashMap
We wiil iterate through the array and find the complenet uusing by subtracting the target and nums[i] and will check if that value is already present in map.If yes the we will the indices of nums[i] and omplement else we will store the nums[i] and its index(i) in the map.

Time complexity:-O(n)
Space Complexity:-O(n)
