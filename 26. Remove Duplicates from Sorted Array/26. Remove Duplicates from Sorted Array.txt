26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/

This question has two solution:-

1.TreeSet
We will have have a Treeset which will store only unique elementsin a sorted way.Now we will convertthat into the array using java8 and will replace the value present in the original arraywith the value present in the araay created using set and rest of the value in the original can remain as it is(We dont need to consider those value) and will return the length of newly created array rom set.
Time complexity:->O(n)
Spce complexity:-O(n)


2.Two pointer Approach
This is optimal solution for this question.As the array is sorted we will have two pointer i and j.We will have the following peudo code:-
int i=0;j=1;
while(j<n)
{
if(nums[i]==nums[j])   //We will check if value at i and j index are same so it means number are duplicte so we will increement j and check next index num
{
j++
}
else
{
nums[++i]=nums[j++]; //If the value at i and j are not same so we will put j value at ++i index and will increment j also.
}
}

return i+1;   //Now we will return the how many number for which duplicate in array.


Time complexity:-O(n)
Space Complexity:-O(1)
