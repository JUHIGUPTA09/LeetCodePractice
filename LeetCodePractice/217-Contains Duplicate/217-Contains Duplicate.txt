217-Contains Duplicate

https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/

This question has two solution:-

1.Sorting
We will sort the array,then we will iterate the array and see if nums[i]==nums[i+1] we will break the loop and flag value will true which indicate that the array contain atleast one duplicate
Time complexity:->O(n logn){Sorting}+O(n)->O(n log n)
Spce complexity:-O(1)


2.HashMap
We will iterate array will put value as key and frequency as value.The we will iterate the map as see if frequency is greater or equal to 2 and break the loop.flag value will true which indicate that the array contain atleast one duplicate


Time complexity:-O(n)
Space Complexity:-O(n)
