137. Single Number II

This question has two solution:-

1.HasHMap
We will create a hashmap and put the number as key and frequency as value.Then we iterate the map and check the number whose frequency is 1 will be unique occurence num.

Time complexity:->O(n)
Spce complexity:-O(n)


2.Bitwise operation
This is optimal solution for this approach.Here we will create two variable one and two which will keep the number which appear one and twice in array.But the number which appear thrice will not be stored anywhere.
the main code is:-
one=(one^x) & ~twice
twice=(twice^x) & ~twice

Time complexity:-O(n)
Space Complexity:-O(1)
