Reverse Array

In reverse Array we will have two index start and end where start=0 and end=num.length-1.We will have the while loop which will iterate till start<end and we swap the value present at start and end index with help of temp variable.

This approach will work for both even and odd length array.

Pseudocode:-
	while(start<end)
	{
		temp=arr[start];
		arr[start]=arr[end];
		arr[end]=temp;
		start++;
		end--;
	}
