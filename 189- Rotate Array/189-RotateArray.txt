189-RotateArray
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/

This question has 3 approches
1.BruteForce
We will have a while loop at the outer and for loop for iterating the array.We will have 2 varialble previous and temp.previous will always take arr[n-1] value and arr[i] value will get stored temp and arr[i] will take previous value and previous will take tem value.

while(n<=k)
	{
		previous=num[num.length-1];
		for(int j=0;j<num.length;j++)
		{
			temp=num[j];
			num[j]=previous;
			previous=temp;
		}
		n++;
	}



Time complexity:->O(n*k)->O(n)k times
Spce complexity:-O(1)


2.New Array
We will create a new array whih store the reverse value of array.Here we have for loop for iterating the array and for new array index we will use following formula.

arr[(i+k)%num.length]=num[i];

Time complexity:-O(n)
Space Complexity:-O(n)


3.Revserse Method

In this method we will create a function implementing the reverse scenrio for the array.We will have follow the following steps:-
1.Reverse the array.
2.Reverse the value from (0 to k-1)
3.Reverse the value from (k to n-1)

We will get the reverse as the output.

Time complexity:-O(n)
Space Complexity:-O(1)
